Boston’s waterfront has formed an important backdrop to the city’s long history of labor and work. The development of Boston's working waterfront has been dynamic, impacting different areas at varying times, resulting in the rise, decline, and resurgence of different activities, trades, and industries.

## Indigenous Labor in the Back Bay
 
Between 2,700 and 400 years ago, indigenous communities settled in what we now know as Boston, attracted by the abundant fish and shellfish in the intertidal zone that once stretched along Boylston Street. Archaeological excavations conducted in the 20th century revealed traces of their labor, as workers involved in building the city's subway and skyscrapers unearthed rows of wooden stakes, identified as "fish weirs." These 100- to 150-foot-long structures were designed to capture small fish with the changing tide. Boston's indigenous people practiced a fishing technique similar to ancient practices worldwide, with groups of 30 to 50 individuals crafting and using these weirs to harvest fish for sustenance and soil replenishment. As sea levels rose and tides fluctuated, indigenous inhabitants continually adapted and rebuilt their fish weirs to higher elevations.
 
## Colonial Labor Practices Along the Harbor
 
The arrival of English colonists in the 17th century transformed Boston Harbor into one of  colonial North America's busiest ports. Colonists engaged in various types of work, including shipbuilding, seafaring, fishing, and trade. Boston became a significant importer of English goods while exporting commodities such as lumber, fish, rum, and newly constructed ships to England and other colonies. In the early 18th century, the city invested in Long Wharf, an extensive 1,500-foot-long structure at the foot of King Street (now State Street), capable of docking up to 50 ships and housing numerous warehouses and trade buildings. Long Wharf was also enmeshed in the transatlantic slave economy. The sugar trade between the Northern colonies and West Indian sugar plantations fueled the fortunes of many Boston merchants and the harbor served as a docking point for ships carrying enslaved Africans and for warehouses where people were sold alongside other imported goods. On the eve of the American Revolution, the Boston waterfront also became a site of labor unrest and mob activity as many workers joined in calls for liberty and independence from Great Britain. The Boston Tea Party of December 1773, for instance, took place on Griffin’s Wharf. Here, a group of Patriotic sympathizers dumped over 300 chests of British tea into the harbor.
 
## Industrial Boston Emerges 

 
Figure 3: This panorama illustrates the evolution of Boston's industrial waterfront in the nineteenth century. Over the course of the 1800s, the city’s maritime reputation waned as new shoemaking and textile factories emerged. 
The 19th century brought great change to the Boston waterfront, as new markets and emerging national economies reshaped the port’s importance on the national stage. The ascent of New York as a prominent port, particularly following the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825, redirected the nation's economic focus away from Boston, emphasizing cities with modern infrastructure, rail networks, and steam-powered capabilities. Boston's significance further dwindled after the Civil War, as the local economy shifted from maritime endeavors to the emergence of new industries like shoemaking and textiles. Along the waterfront, the construction of Atlantic Avenue between 1868 and 1874 further altered the city’s maritime footprint, as it sliced through several former waterfront landmarks including Long Wharf and India Wharf, and made way for the Union Freight Railroad. During this period, a substantial influx of Irish immigrants formed the backbone of the city's burgeoning industrial workforce. Many men engaged in day labor and various trades, while women found employment in domestic service and the textile industry. 






The Modern Port

In the 20th century, the epicenter of Boston’s working waterfront shifted away from downtown to new port facilities on the city’s margins in East and South Boston, and along Fort Port Channel (the industrial area on the edge of what we now call the Seaport District). Here, many workers found jobs supporting the region’s growing containerized shipping industry. World Wars I and II also spurred the growth of the Charlestown Navy Yard, where workers built thousands of ships to support the war effort. Simultaneously, the rise of waterfront labor unions, including the Knights of Labor and the International Long Shoreman’s Association, helped spur large-scale pushes for fair pay and better working conditions for many of Boston’s waterfront workers. 
 
Towards the end of the 20th century, the concept of a waterfront "worker" expanded beyond the traditional roles of fishermen, longshoremen, and industrial laborers, who were prominently visible on the city's numerous piers. It also encompassed less visible yet equally important creative professionals, such as the artists who made their homes by squatting in abandoned warehouses converted into studio spaces in Fort Point. 





The Working Waterfront Today

Today, the Boston waterfront blends both traditional and modern work, where the historic presence of longshoremen's unions and fishermen coexists alongside the hospitality industry, extensive real estate development and construction projects, and the continuous evolution of the port's infrastructure. While the city remains a hub for global shipping and cargo operations, it has also successfully cultivated a vibrant cruise ship industry and a flourishing tourism economy. Boston’s waterfront workers continue to shape the city’s dynamic urban landscape.
